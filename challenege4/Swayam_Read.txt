So, Made 2 tables users and resources 
Now I have pre-made the table and the server.js and database.js opens it in Read mode only
So to get the flag you need to input the resource_id as 3 (I have made it 7 in user's table so that if someone tries to perform IDOR in user_id field it will take a much longer time )

Use command : sqlite3 ctf.db

Now use command : RAGMA table_info(resources);
To get:
0|resource_id|INTEGER|0||1
1|resource_name|TEXT|0||0
2|owner_id|INTEGER|0||0

Now use command : UPDATE resources
SET resource_name = 'Harry follow the link -> <link to the sql injection website>'
WHERE resource_id = 4;

Thats it
