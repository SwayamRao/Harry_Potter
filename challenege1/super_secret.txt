Harry.
I am very happy to see you here.
There's a prophecy made and it says 
"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... 
born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... 
and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... 
and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... 
the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."
